## Projects

### ConsolePrint
A python package for animating terminal/console output and also for saving the console output to a file.  Available for installation from pypi.org/project/ConsolePrint using pip install ConsolePrint.  I presented a demonstration of ConsolePrint at a python forum which can be found here: youtu.be/P6ZLGfAeOAg 

### Code Breaker
A logical guessing game played in the terminal with terminal animations.  The game keeps a log in JSON format of the fastest code breakers and the fewest steps.

### Home Server
I maintain a home server running type 1 hypervisor.  I have several Linux containers (LXC) for my home network ad-blocker, my Cloudflare tunnel running in a docker container, a Python web app created with Flask and served with gunicorn and crypto currency mining software.
